title: "LLMs for utilizing powerful CLI tools with less effort"
date: 2024-02-28
draft: false
---

Some of the CLI tools I also mentioned my [previous blog post](../programmatic-data-crunching-with-cli-tools/) such as `jq` and `awk` used to take a while to pick up in the past due to their special query syntax and peculiar logic. I was curious about how [LLMs (Large Language Models)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) such as ChatGPT (GPT3.5 and GPT4) and Gemini (1.0 Pro and 1.0 Ultra) would measure up for tasks like generating and explaining scripts using these tools, so I put them to a little test. Take the examples and observations below with a grain of salt though, as this test focuses on a specific use-case, it covers only a few tasks using a small set of data processing CLI tools, and uses the particular LLM models that were available to me as of writing.

<!--more-->

My key takeaways so far: LLMs can help to break down the initial barrier for CLI tools with a steeper learning curve, speed up the coding process, and give us fresh ideas. It seems to me though that the tested LLMs are better at understanding and explaining code than writing it, and with increased complexity and niche topics the result can be a hit or miss. It will sometimes generate just the code we were looking for on the first try, but other times, with the same confidence, it will generate buggy code that won't compile even after claiming that it fixed the bug. So I wouldn't blindly trust the code it returns without fully understanding and testing it. Splitting the complex tasks into smaller ones, being more specific in what we want, and doing a few iterations often helps if the answer isn't good enough.

## jq

### avg

**Prompt:**
```text
Use jq to calculate the average of an array of numbers, skipping nulls. Include an example input and output too.
```

{{< tabgroup >}}
{{< tab name="GPT-3.5" >}}
Certainly! Here's how you can calculate the average of an array of numbers while skipping null values using `jq`:

**Input:**
```json
[1, 2, null, 4, null, 6]
```

You can use the following `jq` command to calculate the average:

```bash
echo '[1, 2, null, 4, null, 6]' | jq -r '[.[] | select(. != null)] | add / length'
```

**Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**

- `[.[] | select(. != null)]`: This part of the command filters out null values from the input array.
- `add`: This function computes the sum of the remaining numbers.
- `/ length`: This divides the sum by the count of the remaining numbers, giving the average.
So, the output is `3`, which is the average of the non-null numbers in the input array.

---

**Observations:**
* The `jq` query works as expected.
* Fairly good explanation.
* Slightly inaccurate: the generated command actually returns `3.25` instead of the reported `3`.

{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="GPT-4" >}}
To calculate the average of an array of numbers while skipping `null` values using `jq`, you can follow this approach:

1. **Filter out `null` values** using `select(. != null)`.
2. **Sum the remaining numbers** and **divide by the count** of those numbers to get the average.

Here's a `jq` script for this task:

```sh
jq '[.[] | select(. != null)] | add / length'
```

**Example Input and Output:**

**Input (`input.json`):**

```json
[1, 2, null, 4, 5]
```

**Command:**

```sh
jq '[.[] | select(. != null)] | add / length' input.json
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
3
```

**Explanation:**

- `[.[] | select(. != null)]`: This creates a new array with all `null` values filtered out.
- `add / length`: Sums the values of the filtered array and then divides by the length of this array to compute the average.

This `jq` command processes the input array to compute the average of its numbers, excluding any `null` values.

---

**Observations:**
* The same `jq` query as in the GPT-3.5 solution.
* A little better explanation for `[.[] | select(. != null)]`.
* Minor: both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 solutions could have used a bit simpler code: `del(.. | nulls)` or `map(select(. != null))` instead of `[.[] | select(. != null)]`.

{{< tab name="Gemini 1.0 Pro" >}}
Here's the jq command to calculate the average of an array of numbers, skipping nulls:

```jq
reduce .[] as $x (0; . + if $x != null then $x else 0 end) / length | if . > 0 then . else 0 end
```

**Explanation:**

1. `reduce .[] as $x`: Reduces the array of numbers to a single value.
    - `$x`: refers to the current element in the loop.
2. `(0; . + if $x != null then $x else 0 end)`: This part accumulates the sum of non-null elements.
    - `0;`: Initializes the accumulator to 0.
    - `. + if $x != null then $x else 0 end`: Adds the current element (`$x`) to the accumulator only if it's not null. Otherwise, it adds 0.
3. `/ length`: Divides the accumulated sum by the length of the array to get the average.
4. `if . > 0 then . else 0 end`: Handles cases where the entire array consists of nulls. It checks if the average is greater than 0 and returns the average if true, otherwise returns 0.

**Example Input:**

```json
[10, null, 5, null, 20]
```

**Example Output:**

```
12.5
```

This command uses a reducer to accumulate the sum of non-null values and then calculates the average considering the actual number of elements (excluding nulls). If all elements are null, it returns 0 to avoid division by zero.

---

**Observations:**
* The generated code handles nulls when calculating the sum, but fails to subtract the number of nulls from the input length before dividing the sum. Also, I wouldn't use `reduce` for such a simple task like a sum (`jq` has an `add` method).
* Wrong output: the generated command returns 7 instead of the reported 12.5, but it should actually return ~11.667.
* It explains well the different parts of the code.

Absolutely! Here's how you can use jq to accomplish this:

**Understanding jq**

jq is a command-line tool designed to process and filter JSON data. It's incredibly useful for extracting and manipulating the information you need from JSON structures.

**Steps**

1. **Filter out nulls:**
   ```bash
   jq '.numbers[] | select(. != null)'
   ```
   This filters the `numbers` array, keeping only non-null numbers.

2. **Calculate the average:**
   ```bash
   jq '(.numbers[] | select(. != null)) | add / length' 
   ```
   This part sums the filtered numbers and divides by their count.

**Example**

**Input JSON (`data.json`):**
```json
{
  "numbers": [1, 2, null, 3, 4, null, 5]
}
```

**Command:**
```bash
jq '(.numbers[] | select(. != null)) | add / length' data.json 
```

**Output:**
```
3
```

---

**Observations:**
* The generated code doesn't compile: `jq: error (at input.json:2): Cannot iterate over number (1)`. The fix is easy though: either wrap the `(.numbers[] | select(. != null))` part inside `[]` to make it an array that `add` can use, or use `map` like so: `.numbers | map(select(. != null))`.
* The output is correct.
* Not too detailed explanation.

### median

**Prompt:**
```text
Use jq to calculate the median of an array of numbers, skipping nulls. Include an example input and output too.
```

{{< tabgroup >}}
{{< tab name="GPT-3.5" >}}
To calculate the median of an array of numbers while skipping null values using `jq`, you'll first need to sort the non-null values and then find the middle value or the average of the two middle values depending on whether the number of elements is odd or even. Here's how you can achieve that:

**Input:**
```json
[3, 6, null, 2, 9, null, 1]
```

You can use the following `jq` command to calculate the median:

```bash
echo '[3, 6, null, 2, 9, null, 1]' | jq -n '[inputs | select(. != null) | tonumber] | sort | if length % 2 == 0 then (.[length/2-1] + .[length/2]) / 2 else .[length/2] end'
```

**Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**

- `[inputs | select(. != null) | tonumber]`: This filters out null values, converts the remaining values to numbers, and reads the input as an array.
- `sort`: This sorts the array of non-null numbers.
- `if length % 2 == 0 then (.[length/2-1] + .[length/2]) / 2 else .[length/2] end`: This conditional expression checks if the length of the array is even or odd. If it's even, it calculates the average of the two middle values; otherwise, it selects the middle value.

So, the output is `3`, which is the median of the non-null numbers in the input array.

---

**Observations:**
* The generated code won't compile: `jq: error (at <stdin>:1): array ([3,6,null,2...) cannot be parsed as a number`. But it's actually a small mistake, we just need to append `[]` after the `inputs` method to convert the array to a stream.
* Correct explanation.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="GPT-4" >}}
To calculate the median of an array of numbers while skipping `null` values with `jq`, you need to filter out the `null` values, sort the numbers, and then find the middle value or the average of the two middle values if the array has an even number of elements. Here's how you can do it:

**`jq` Script:**

```sh
jq 'map(select(. != null)) | sort | if length == 0 then empty elif length % 2 == 1 then .[length / 2 | floor] else (.[length / 2 - 1] + .[length / 2]) / 2 end'
```

**Example Input (`input.json`):**

```json
[3, 1, null, 2, 4]
```

**Command:**

```sh
jq 'map(select(. != null)) | sort | if length == 0 then empty elif length % 2 == 1 then .[length / 2 | floor] else (.[length / 2 - 1] + .[length / 2]) / 2 end' input.json
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
2
```

**Explanation:**

- `map(select(. != null))`: Filters out `null` values from the array.
- `sort`: Sorts the remaining numbers in ascending order.
- `if length == 0 then empty`: Handles the case where the array is empty after removing `null` values.
- `elif length % 2 == 1 then .[length / 2 | floor]`: If the array has an odd number of elements, it returns the middle element.
- `else (.[length / 2 - 1] + .[length / 2]) / 2 end`: If the array has an even number of elements, it calculates the average of the two middle elements.

This `jq` command calculates the median of the provided numbers, excluding any `null` values.

---

**Observations:**
* The generated code works and if we run it then it returns the correct value (2.5). It uses a slightly more elegant null filtering and handles the empty array edge case (after removing the nulls).
* Slightly inaccurate output: GPT-4 returned 2 instead of 2.5.
* Detailed explanation.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="Gemini 1.0 Pro" >}}
Here's the jq command to calculate the median of an array of numbers, skipping nulls:

```jq
reduce .[] as $x ([]; . + if $x != null then $x else [] end) | sort | 
  if length % 2 == 1 then .[(length // 2)] else (.[(length // 2) - 1] + .[length // 2]) / 2 end
```

**Explanation:**

1. `reduce .[] as $x ([]; . + if $x != null then $x else [] end)`: Reduces the array to an array containing only non-null numbers.
    - `[];`: Initializes an empty array as the accumulator.
    - `. + if $x != null then $x else [] end`: Appends the current element (`$x`) to the accumulator only if it's not null. Otherwise, it appends an empty array.
2. `sort`: Sorts the filtered array in ascending order.
3. `if length % 2 == 1 then .[(length // 2)] else (.[(length // 2) - 1] + .[length // 2]) / 2 end`: This conditional expression calculates the median based on the number of elements:
    - `length % 2 == 1`: Checks if the length is odd.
        - `.[(length // 2)]`: If odd, the median is the middle element (using integer division `//` to get the index).
    - `else`: If the length is even:
        - `.[(length // 2) - 1] + .[length // 2]`: Accesses the two middle elements.
        - `/ 2`: Calculates the average of the two middle elements.

**Example Input:**

```json
[10, null, 5, null, 20, 15]
```

**Example Output:**

```
15
```

This command filters out nulls, sorts the remaining numbers, and then calculates the median depending on the number of elements (odd or even) while handling edge cases like an empty array or all null values.

---

**Observations:**
* The generated code won't compile: `jq: error (at input.json:0): array ([]) and number (10) cannot be added`. It's easy to fix the sum by wrapping `$x` in `[]` to make it an array: `reduce .[] as $x ([]; . + if $x != null then [$x] else [] end)`, but again, I wouldn't use `reduce` for a sum. It also uses the _alternative operator_ `//` instead of the _division operator_ `/`.
* Wrong output: it should return 12.5, but it reports 15 and returns 10 (with only the sum fix).
* As I mentioned above, the `//` is not the division operator, though Gemini states that. Otherwise it's an adequate explanation.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="Gemini 1.0 Ultra" >}}
Absolutely! Here's how to calculate the median using jq while filtering out null values:

**Explanation**

1. **Filter out nulls:** As before, we start by removing nulls:
   ```bash
   jq '.numbers[] | select(. != null)'
   ```

2. **Sort the array:** The median requires a sorted array:
   ```bash
   jq '(.numbers[] | select(. != null)) | sort'
   ```

3. **Calculate the median:**
   ```bash
   jq '
     (.numbers[] | select(. != null)) | sort | 
     (length / 2 | floor) as $mid |
     if length % 2 == 0 then 
       (.[$mid - 1] + .[$mid]) / 2 
     else 
       .[floor(length / 2)] 
     end'
   ```
   This part handles both cases:
     * **Even number of elements:** Calculate the average of the two middle values.
     * **Odd number of elements:**  Take the middle value directly.

**Example**

**Input JSON (`data.json`):**
```json
{
  "numbers": [1, 2, null, 3, 4, null, 5]
}
```

**Command:**
```bash
jq '
  (.numbers[] | select(. != null)) | sort | 
  (length / 2 | floor) as $mid |
  if length % 2 == 0 then 
    (.[$mid - 1] + .[$mid]) / 2 
  else 
    .[floor(length / 2)] 
  end' data.json
```

**Output:**
```
3
```

---

**Observations:**
* The generated code won't compile: `jq: error: floor/1 is not defined at <top-level>, line 7:`. It's interesting that Gemini used the correct `floor/0` method once but than also hallucinates the `floor/1` which doesn't exist. Fixing this bug is easy, just use `floor/0` instead of `floor/1`, just like it did a few lines before `length / 2 | floor`. Then we hit the same bug as with the `avg` example, so the same fix applies for the `.numbers[] | select(. != null)` part.
* The reported output is correct.
* The explanation could go into a bit more details.

### objs2csv

**Prompt:**
```text
Use jq to convert an array of objects to a CSV without sorting the keys. Use the object keys as CSV headers. Include an example input and output too.
```
  
{{< tabgroup >}}
{{< tab name="GPT-3.5" >}}
Here's how you can convert an array of objects to CSV format without sorting the keys, using the object keys as CSV headers:

Let's say you have an array of objects like this:

**Input:**
```json
[
  {"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"},
  {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "Los Angeles"},
  {"name": "Bob", "age": 35, "city": "Chicago"}
]
```

You can use `jq` to achieve this:

```bash
echo '[{"name": "John", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}, {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "city": "Los Angeles"}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 35, "city": "Chicago"}]' | jq -r '([.[0] | keys_unsorted] | join(",")), (.[] | [.[]]) | @csv'
```

**Explanation:**

- `[.[0] | keys_unsorted] | join(",")`: Extracts the keys of the first object in the array without sorting them and joins them with a comma to create the CSV header.
- `(.[] | [.[]])`: Converts each object into an array of its values.
- `@csv`: Converts the array of values into CSV format.

**Output:**

```
"name","age","city"
"John",30,"New York"
"Alice",25,"Los Angeles"
"Bob",35,"Chicago"
```

This produces a CSV with the object keys as headers and preserves the original order of keys.

---

**Observations:**
* The generated code won't compile: `jq: error (at <stdin>:1): string ("") and array (["name","ag...) cannot be added`. ChatGPT missed a `[]` after the `keys_unsorted` method and shouldn't have tried to join the header row separately and then also pass it to the `@csv` method, but rather keep it as an array and convert it with the same `@csv` method that we use for the other rows: `jq -r '(.[0] | keys_unsorted), (.[] | [.[]]) | @csv'`.
* It makes an assumption, that every object in the array have the same keys as the first one from where it takes the header names.
* Sufficient explanation.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="GPT-4" >}}
To convert an array of objects to CSV format using `jq` without sorting the keys and using the object keys as CSV headers, you will need to:
1. Extract the keys from the first object in the array to use as headers.
2. Map each object in the array to an array of its values, preserving the order of keys as found in the first object.
3. Prepend the headers to the array of values.
4. Convert the arrays to CSV lines.

Here's an example `jq` script to achieve this:

```sh
jq -r '
  (map(keys_unsorted) | add | unique) as $headers |
  $headers, map([.[]])[] |
  @csv
' input.json
```

**Example Input and Output:**

Given an input `input.json` file like this:

```json
[
  {"name": "John Doe", "age": 30, "city": "New York"},
  {"name": "Jane Smith", "age": 25, "city": "Los Angeles"},
  {"city": "Chicago", "age": 28, "name": "Mike Brown"}
]
```

This `jq` command would produce the following CSV output:

```
"name","age","city"
"John Doe",30,"New York"
"Jane Smith",25,"Los Angeles"
"Mike Brown",28,"Chicago"
```

**Explanation:**

- `map(keys_unsorted) | add | unique as $headers`: This extracts all keys from all objects without sorting, combines them into a single array, removes duplicates, and assigns the result to the `$headers` variable. This assumes that all objects have the same keys. If some objects might be missing keys present in others, this approach still works because `keys_unsorted` from each object is combined with `add` and then made unique.
- `$headers, map([.[]])[] | @csv`: Prepends the headers to the list of rows. Each object is then mapped to an array of its values in the order of `$headers`. The `@csv` filter converts arrays to CSV lines.
- `-r`: Outputs raw strings, not JSON-encoded strings, to produce proper CSV format.

**Note:** This solution assumes that all objects have the same keys in the same order. If the objects have different keys or the key order varies significantly, the CSV output may not align as expected.

---

**Observations:**
* There generated code compiles, but it has even more limitations than the one generated by GPT-3.5 (to be fair, that needed 2 fixes to compile), and it sorts the headers (the side effect of the `unique` method) though we explicitly asked it not to do so.
* It also makes an assumption, that every object in the array have the same keys as the first one from where it takes the header names. Though we can see some clumsy attempts from GPT-4 that it tries to make the headers more dynamic by getting the unique headers from all objects not just the first one, it simply dumps the other object keys/rows in their original order, mixing up the headers and rows unless we have the very same keys in the very same order in every object.
* _"Each object is then mapped to an array of its values in the order of $headers."_ -> At least, it has the right idea and explains well what it should do, but that's not how the generated code works.
* Despite my nitpicking, the code is a good starting point, and it's not that hard to fix: we can use `(reduce .[] as $item ({}; . + $item) | keys_unsorted)` instead of `map(keys_unsorted) | add | unique` to keep the original order of the keys but still removing any dupes, and filter the inner array value iterator `.[]` with the `$headers[]` in the `map([.[]])[]` expression to get the keys in the same order as in the header. The final code is this: `jq -r '(reduce .[] as $item ({}; . + $item) | keys_unsorted) as $headers | $headers, map([.[$headers[]]])[] | @csv' input.json`.

{{< tab name="Gemini 1.0 Pro" >}}
Here's the improved jq command to convert an array of objects to a CSV without sorting the keys, using the object keys as headers:

```jq
.[] | to_entries | flatten | group_by(.key) | map({key, values: .[]}) | map({key, value: .values | join(",")}) | @csv
```

**Explanation:**

1. `.[] | to_entries | flatten`: Iterates through each object, converts it to key-value pairs, and then flattens the resulting array into a single list of key-value pairs.
2. `group_by(.key)`: Groups the key-value pairs by their keys. This ensures that all values associated with a specific key are grouped together.
3. `map({key, values: .[]})`: Creates a new object for each group. The "key" property remains the same, and a new "values" property is added that contains an array of all values associated with that key.
4. `map({key, value: .values | join(",")})`: Iterates through each group and creates a new object. The "key" remains the same, and a new "value" property is added. This property is created by joining all the values associated with the key into a single string using commas (",") as separators.
5. `@csv`: Converts the final array of objects into a CSV string with commas (",") as separators.

**Example Input:**

```json
[
  { "name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York" },
  { "age": 25, "name": "Bob", "country": "Canada" }
]
```

**Example Output:**

```csv
name,age,city,country
Alice,30,New York,
Bob,25,,,Canada
```

**Improvements:**

- This version uses `flatten` to ensure a single list of key-value pairs before grouping.
- It explicitly joins the values with a comma (",") for clarity.
- It addresses potential edge cases where some objects might not have all keys, resulting in empty values in the CSV. In these cases, empty strings (`""`) are added to maintain consistent structure.

This refined command provides a more robust and efficient solution for converting an array of objects to a CSV, preserving the original key order and handling potential variations in object structures.

---

**Observations:**
* The generated code won't compile: `jq: error (at input.json:3): Cannot index array with string "key"`. But it's far from a working solution: it tries to use `flatten` on a stream instead of an array, it sorts the keys though we explicitly asked not to do so, it really struggles with mapping and does not even try to map the objects into a multidimensional array that the `@csv` function requires.
* The generated output is almost correct, it misses the double quotes that `@csv` produces.
* It provides a detailed explanation for the different pieces, which is mostly but not fully accurate or complete, so it can be a bit misleading.

{{< tab name="Gemini 1.0 Ultra" >}}
Absolutely! Here's how to convert an array of objects into CSV format using jq while preserving the original key order:

**Steps**

1. **Get the headers:**
   ```bash
   jq -r '.[0] | keys_unsorted | @csv'
   ``` 

2. **Get the values (one row at a time):**
   ```bash
   jq -r '.[] | [.[]] | @csv'
   ```

**Example**

**Input JSON (`data.json`):**
```json
[
  {"color": "red", "size": "large", "price": 15},
  {"size": "small", "price": 8, "color": "blue"}
]
```

**Command:**
```bash
jq -r '.[0] | keys_unsorted | @csv' data.json > headers.csv
jq -r '.[] | [.[]] | @csv' data.json >> data.csv
```

**Output (`headers.csv`):**
```
color,size,price
```

**Output (`data.csv`):** 
```
red,large,15
blue,small,8
```

**Explanation**

* `keys_unsorted`: Ensures the original order of keys is used for the header row.
* `.[0]`: Gets the first object in the array to generate the headers.
* `.[].[]`: Transforms each object, preserving the existing key order.
* `@csv`: Formats the output as CSV.

**Important Note:** For consistent results, it's crucial that all objects in your input array share the same set of keys, even if some values are null.

---

**Observations:**
* The generated code compiles, but it generates 2 CSV instead of one, it unnecessarily uses two separate `jq` calls and writes, and in addition to that it makes the same mistakes as the GPT3.5 solution.
* Not sure where it got `.[].[]` from in the explanation. Otherwise it's fine.

## awk

### union

**Prompt:**
```text
Use awk to get the union of 2 or more files without sorting the lines. Include an example input and output too.
```
  
{{< tabgroup >}}
{{< tab name="GPT-3.5" >}}
If you want to get the union of two or more files without sorting the lines, you can keep track of the lines seen in each file and print them as encountered. Here's how you can achieve this:

Let's say you have two example files named `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` with the following contents:

**file1.txt:**
```
apple
banana
orange
```

**file2.txt:**
```
banana
grape
kiwi
```

You can use the following `awk` command to get the union of these two files without sorting the lines:

```bash
awk '!seen[$0]++' file1.txt file2.txt
```

**Output:**
```
apple
banana
orange
grape
kiwi
```

**Explanation:**

- `!seen[$0]++`: This statement keeps track of each line encountered (`$0` represents the current line). It evaluates to true only if the current line has not been seen before, thus removing duplicates.
- `file1.txt file2.txt`: This specifies the input files to `awk`.

This command will output the union of the contents of `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, preserving the original order of lines without sorting.

---

**Observations:**
* The generated code is spot on, I was a bit surprised ChatGPT knows this small `awk` trick.
* Clear explanation.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="GPT-4" >}}
To achieve the union of two or more files using `awk` without sorting the lines, you can use `awk` in a way that it reads through each file and prints lines that haven't been printed before. This method ensures that lines are output in the order they are encountered across the files, maintaining the original order within each file.

Here's how you can do it:

**`awk` Command:**

```sh
awk '!seen[$0]++' file1.txt file2.txt ...
```

This command uses an associative array `seen` where each line of text encountered is used as a key. The value associated with each key is incremented every time the line is encountered, but the line is only printed the first time (`!seen[$0]++` evaluates to true).

**Example:**

**Input:**

**`file1.txt`:**

```
apple
banana
grape
```

**`file2.txt`:**

```
banana
orange
apple
```

**`file3.txt`** (optional, to demonstrate with more than 2 files):

```
kiwi
grape
```

**Command:**

```sh
awk '!seen[$0]++' file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

**Output:**

```
apple
banana
grape
orange
kiwi
```

**Explanation:**

- Lines are printed in the order they are first encountered across the input files.
- The `banana` and `apple` lines from `file2.txt` are not printed again since they were already printed from `file1.txt`.
- The `grape` line from `file3.txt` is not printed again since it was already printed from `file1.txt`.
- The `kiwi` line is new and thus printed.

This method is efficient for finding the union of lines across multiple files, preserving the original order of lines without sorting.

Here's the `awk` command to get the union of 2 or more files without sorting the lines:

```awk '
FNR == NR { 
  seen[$0]++ 
  next 
} 
seen[$0] 
' file1 file2 ...
```

**Explanation:**

1. `FNR == NR { ...; next }`: This block checks if the current record number (FNR) is equal to the record number within the current file (NR). This condition is only true when processing the first file.
2. `seen[$0]++`: If the condition is true, it increments the count of the current line (`$0`) in the associative array `seen`. This effectively stores all unique lines from the first file.
3. `next`: After storing the line from the first file, the `next` statement skips to the next line in the current file.
4. `seen[$0]`: This checks if the current line (`$0`) from any subsequent file exists as a key in the `seen` array.
5. `print`: If the line exists in the `seen` array (meaning it was encountered in the first file), it gets printed.

**Example Input:**

**file1:**

```
line1
line2
line3
```

**file2:**

```
line2
line4
line5
```

**Output:**

```
line1
line2
line3
line4
line5
```

**Note:**

- This approach uses an associative array (`seen`) to keep track of unique lines encountered in the first file.
- Lines encountered in subsequent files are only printed if they already exist in the `seen` array, effectively achieving the union operation without sorting.
- This method ensures the order of lines is preserved as they appear in the original files.

---

**Observations:**
* Gemini messed up the markdown code block here a bit, so the `awk '` part is missing from the beginning of the rendered output.
* The generated code returns `file2` which is clearly wrong. It overcomplicates things.
* It mixes up FNR and NR, but otherwise explains the different parts of the code well.

{{< tab name="Gemini 1.0 Ultra" >}}
Here's how you can use awk to achieve this:

**Understanding the Approach**

1. **Store seen lines:** We'll use an awk associative array to keep track of lines we've already encountered.
2. **Print unique lines:** Iterate through each file, printing only lines that haven't been seen before.

**Example**

**File 1 (`file1.txt`):**
```
line A
line B
line C
```

**File 2 (`file2.txt`)**
```
line C
line D
line A
```

**Command:**
```bash
awk '!seen[$0]++' file1.txt file2.txt
```

**Output:**
```
line A
line B
line C
line D
```

**Explanation**

* `!seen[$0]++`: This condition is true the first time a line (`$0`) is encountered. The `++` increments the count in the `seen` array, making the condition false for subsequent occurrences of the same line.

**Key Points**

* **Order Preservation:** The output order follows the appearance of lines in the input files.
* **Multiple Files:** You can easily add more files to the awk command (e.g., `awk '!seen[$0]++' file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt`)

**Observations:**
* Same `awk` trick that ChatGPT used.
* Mostly satisfying explanation.

### max

**Prompt:**
```text
Use awk to get the max number from the input lines. Include an example input and output too.
```
    
{{< tabgroup >}}
{{< tab name="GPT-3.5" >}}
You can use `awk` to find the maximum number from the input lines by keeping track of the maximum value encountered. Here's how you can achieve this:

Let's say you have an example file named `numbers.txt` with the following contents:

**numbers.txt:**
```
10
5
8
13
2
```

You can use the following `awk` command to get the maximum number from the input lines:

```bash
awk 'max < $1 { max = $1 } END { print max }' numbers.txt
```

**Output:**
```
13
```

**Explanation:**

- `max < $1 { max = $1 }`: This statement checks if the current number (`$1`) is greater than the current maximum (`max`). If so, it updates the maximum value to the current number.
- `END { print max }`: This block executes after processing all lines in the input file. It prints the maximum value found.

This command will output the maximum number (`13`) from the input lines in the file `numbers.txt`.

---

**Observations:**
* The generated code works for positive numbers, but it doesn't return anything if there are only negative numbers. Though I could have been more specific and ask it to handle negative numbers too.
* Good explanation.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="GPT-4" >}}
To find the maximum number from a list of numbers using `awk`, you can process each line of input, compare it with the maximum value found so far, and update the maximum value if the current number is greater. Here's a simple `awk` command to do this:

**`awk` Command:**

```sh
awk 'NR == 1 || $1 > max { max = $1 } END { print max }' file.txt
```

This command does the following:
- `NR == 1 || $1 > max { max = $1 }`: For the first record (`NR == 1`) or if the current line's first field (`$1`) is greater than the current `max`, update `max` to this value. `$1` is used assuming each line contains a single number; if numbers are not in the first field, adjust `$1` accordingly.
- `END { print max }`: After processing all lines, print the maximum value found.

**Example:**

**Input (`file.txt`):**

```
5
3
10
6
2
```

**Command:**

```sh
awk 'NR == 1 || $1 > max { max = $1 } END { print max }' file.txt
```

**Output:**

```
10
```

**Explanation:**

- The `awk` script starts with assuming the first number (`5`) as the maximum.
- It then reads each subsequent number, updating the maximum value if a larger number is found.
- Upon reaching the end of the file, it prints the maximum number found, which is `10` in this case.

This method efficiently computes the maximum value in a list of numbers contained in a file, using `awk`.

---

**Observations:**
* The generated code works for both positive and negative numbers.
* Slightly more verbose explanation.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="Gemini 1.0 Pro" >}}
Here's the `awk` command to get the max number from the input lines:

```awk '
BEGIN { max = "" }  # Initialize max to an empty string
{ if ($1 > max) max = $1 }
END { print max }
'
```

**Explanation:**

1. `BEGIN { max = "" }`: This block runs before processing any lines. It initializes a variable named `max` with an empty string. This is important because `awk` treats empty strings as 0 in numeric comparisons.
2. `{ if ($1 > max) max = $1 }`: This block gets executed for each line in the input.
    - `$1`: Accesses the first field (column) of the current line.
    - `if ($1 > max)`: Checks if the current number (`$1`) is greater than the current `max`.
    - `max = $1`: If the condition is true, it updates the `max` variable with the current number.
3. `END { print max }`: This block runs after processing all lines. It prints the final value of `max`, which holds the largest number encountered.

**Example Input:**

```
10
5
20
12
```

**Output:**

```
20
```

This command uses a single variable `max` to track the maximum number encountered throughout the input. It compares each line's first field with the current `max` and updates it if a larger number is found. Finally, it prints the final `max` value after processing all lines.

---

**Observations:**
* Again, Gemini messed up the markdown code block a bit.
* The generated code works as expected. It handles both positive and negative numbers.
* Good explanation.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="Gemini 1.0 Ultra" >}}
Absolutely! Here's how to find the maximum number using awk:

**Example**

**Input (`numbers.txt`)**
```
5
12
3
8 
```

**Command**
```bash
awk 'NR==1 {max=$1} $1>max {max=$1} END {print max}' numbers.txt
```

**Output**
```
12
```

**Explanation**

1. **Initialization:** `NR==1 {max=$1}`  When processing the first line (NR==1), the first field ($1) is assigned as the initial `max`.
2. **Comparison and Update:** `$1>max {max=$1}`  For each subsequent line, if the first field ($1) is greater than the current `max`, update `max`.
3. **Final Output:** `END {print max}` After processing all lines, print the final value of `max`. 

**Key Points:**

* This assumes numbers are in the first field of each line. 
* If you have multiple numbers per line, you could iterate through the fields in a loop.

---

**Observations:**
* Similar to the GPT-4 generated code, but the first two if condition could have been merged like in the GPT-4 code.
* Same good explanation.

### stddev

**Prompt:**
```text
Use awk to calculate the sample standard deviation of the input lines. Include an example input and output too.
```
  
{{< tabgroup >}}
{{< tab name="GPT-3.5" >}}
Calculating the sample standard deviation using `awk` involves a multistep process. You first need to compute the mean, then compute the sum of squared differences from the mean, divide it by the count of elements minus one, and finally take the square root of the result. Here's how you can achieve this:

Let's say you have an example file named `data.txt` with the following contents:

**data.txt:**
```
10
5
8
13
2
```

You can use the following `awk` command to calculate the sample standard deviation:

```bash
awk '
{
    sum += $1
    sumSq += ($1)^2
    count++
}
END {
    mean = sum / count
    variance = (sumSq - sum^2 / count) / (count - 1)
    stddev = sqrt(variance)
    print stddev
}
' data.txt
```

**Output:**
```
4.4833
```

**Explanation:**

- `sum += $1`: This statement accumulates the sum of all numbers.
- `sumSq += ($1)^2`: This statement accumulates the sum of squares of all numbers.
- `count++`: This statement increments the count of numbers.
- `END { ... }`: This block executes after processing all lines in the input file.
  - `mean = sum / count`: This calculates the mean of the numbers.
  - `variance = (sumSq - sum^2 / count) / (count - 1)`: This calculates the variance using the formula `((sum of squares) - (sum)^2 / N) / (N - 1)`.
  - `stddev = sqrt(variance)`: This calculates the standard deviation by taking the square root of the variance.
  - `print stddev`: This prints the standard deviation.

This command will output the sample standard deviation (`4.4833`) of the input lines in the file `data.txt`.

---

**Observations:**
* The code works and if we run it then it returns the expected value (4.27785).
* Wrong generated output: 4.4833 instead of 4.27785. I have no idea where it got that number from.
* Solid explanation.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="GPT-4" >}}
To calculate the sample standard deviation of a set of numbers using `awk`, you need to perform a two-pass analysis on the data. The first pass calculates the mean of the data, and the second pass uses the mean to calculate the variance. The standard deviation is then the square root of the variance. 

Here's how you can do it with `awk`:

**`awk` Script:**

```sh
awk '{
    sum += $1; 
    count++
} 
END {
    mean = sum / count;
    for (i in arr) {
        sumsq += ((arr[i] - mean) ^ 2);
    }
    variance = sumsq / (count - 1);
    stddev = sqrt(variance);
    print stddev;
}' file.txt
```

This script does not work as-is because standard `awk` does not support storing the entire dataset for a second pass within the `END` block without explicitly doing so. We need to adjust our approach to store values during the first pass:

**`awk` Command:**

```sh
awk '{arr[NR] = $1; sum += $1} END {mean = sum / NR; for (i=1; i<=NR; i++) {sumsq += (arr[i] - mean)^2;} variance = sumsq / (NR-1); print sqrt(variance)}' file.txt
```

**Example:**

**Input (`file.txt`):**

```
4
7
13
16
```

**Command:**

```sh
awk '{arr[NR] = $1; sum += $1} END {mean = sum / NR; for (i=1; i<=NR; i++) {sumsq += (arr[i] - mean)^2;} variance = sumsq / (NR-1); print sqrt(variance)}' file.txt
```

**Output:**

```
5.1235
```

**Explanation:**

- In the first pass (within the main block `{}`), this script accumulates the sum of all numbers and stores each number in the array `arr`.
- In the `END` block, it calculates the mean of the numbers, then iterates over `arr` to calculate the sum of squares (`sumsq`) of the differences between each number and the mean.
- The variance is calculated by dividing `sumsq` by `(NR-1)`, where `NR` is the number of records (subtracting 1 makes it a sample variance calculation).
- Finally, it prints the square root of the variance, which is the sample standard deviation.

This approach allows for the calculation of the sample standard deviation of a list of numbers contained in a file using `awk`.

---

**Observations:**
* The code uses a slightly different implementation, but it also returns the expected value (5.47723).
* Wrong generated output: 5.1235 instead of 5.47723. No idea where ChatGPT got that number from.
* Not sure why it included the same code block twice.
* Good explanation.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="Gemini 1.0 Pro" >}}
Here's the `awk` command to calculate the sample standard deviation of the input lines:

```awk '
BEGIN { 
  count = 0 
  sum = 0 
  sumsq = 0 
} 
{ 
  count++ 
  sum += $1 
  sumsq += $1 * $1 
} 
END { 
  if (count == 0) { 
    print "Error: No data provided" 
  } else { 
    mean = sum / count 
    variance = (sumsq - count * mean * mean) / (count - 1) 
    stddev = sqrt(variance) 
    printf("%.2f\n", stddev) 
  } 
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**
    - `BEGIN { ... }`: This block runs before processing any lines.
    - `count = 0`: Initializes a variable `count` to keep track of the number of lines.
    - `sum = 0`: Initializes a variable `sum` to accumulate the sum of all values.
    - `sumsq = 0`: Initializes a variable `sumsq` to accumulate the sum of squares of all values.
2. **Processing each line:**
    - `{ ... }`: This block gets executed for each line in the input.
    - `count++`: Increments the `count` variable for each line.
    - `sum += $1`: Adds the current line's value (`$1`) to the `sum`.
    - `sumsq += $1 * $1`: Squares the current value and adds it to `sumsq`.
3. **Calculation and output:**
    - `END { ... }`: This block runs after processing all lines.
    - `if (count == 0) { ... }`: Checks if there were any lines (no data).
        - `print "Error: No data provided"`: Prints an error message if no data was provided.
    - `else { ... }`: If there was data:
        - `mean = sum / count`: Calculates the sample mean.
        - `variance = (sumsq - count * mean * mean) / (count - 1)`: Calculates the sample variance.
        - `stddev = sqrt(variance)`: Calculates the sample standard deviation.
        - `printf("%.2f\n", stddev)`: Prints the standard deviation with two decimal places.

**Example Input:**

```
10
5
20
12
```

**Output:**

```
5.29
```

This `awk` script calculates the sample standard deviation considering it's an estimate of the population standard deviation and uses `count - 1` in the variance calculation. It also includes error handling for cases with no data input.

---

**Observations:**
* Again, the previously mentioned markdown code block issue.
* The generated code works and returns the expected output. It also does some rounding. It's not necessary to initialize the variables with 0 in `awk`, and could have used the power operator `^2` instead of multiplying the variables with themselves.
* The generated output 5.29 is wrong, but the code returns the correct output 6.24.
* Adequate explanation.
{{< /tab >}}

{{< tab name="Gemini 1.0 Ultra" >}}
Sure, here's how to calculate the sample standard deviation using awk:

**Example**

**Input (`numbers.txt`)**
```
5
12
3
8
```

**Command**
```bash
awk '
{
    sum += $1
    sq_sum += $1 ^ 2
    n++
}
END {
    mean = sum / n
    var = (sq_sum - n * mean ^ 2) / (n - 1)
    sd = sqrt(var)
    printf "Sample standard deviation: %.2f\n", sd
}
' numbers.txt
```

**Output**
```
Sample standard deviation: 3.92
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Accumulator variables:** The `awk` script initializes three variables:
   - `sum`: Stores the sum of all numbers.
   - `sq_sum`: Stores the sum of squared deviations from the mean.
   - `n`: Counts the number of lines (number of elements).
2. **Processing lines:** The `awk` script iterates over each line in the input file:
   - For each line, it adds the current number (`$1`) to both `sum` and `sq_sum`.
   - It increments the counter `n`.
3. **Calculate mean and variance:** After processing all lines, the script calculates:
   - `mean`: The average of all numbers (`sum / n`).
   - `var`: The sample variance (`(sq_sum - n * mean ^ 2) / (n - 1)`).
4. **Calculate standard deviation:** The script calculates the sample standard deviation (`sd`) as the square root of the variance (`sqrt(var)`).
5. **Print output:** Finally, the script prints the sample standard deviation formatted to two decimal places.

**Key Points:**

* This awk script assumes the numbers are in the first field of each line.
* The sample standard deviation is calculated using the formula for a finite population (`n - 1` in the denominator).

---

**Observations:**
* The generated code is correct. Gemini Ultra didn't make the same (small) mistakes as Gemini Pro.
* Mostly good explanation.
